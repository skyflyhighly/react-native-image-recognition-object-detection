# Image Recognition and Object Detection with React Native/Expo

This app demonstrates several pre-trained deep convolutional neural network models to classify images and detect objects on mobile devices. It is developed using Expo/React Native, and works on both iOS and Android devices.

## Available Demos:

__Classify Image:__ image classification using TensorFlow.js w/ MobileNet model

__Detect Objects:__ mutiple object detection using TensorFlow.js w/ COCO-SSD model

__Food Detect:__ multiple food item detection using Clarifai Food model (remote API) *

\* To run the "Detect Foods" demo, sign up for a free account at https://clarifai.com, obtain an API key, copy `.env.example` file to `.env` and add the API key. Make sure to verify your email address otherwise they will limit your account to 100 requests.
